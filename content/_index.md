Hi, I'm Julius. At the age of 9 I have taught myself how to program in Java. After participating successfully in the national competition for computer science I decided to study at TU Darmstadt. In 2021 I finished my Bachelor's degree at the age of 20. I'm currently doing my Master of Science at University Hamburg.
